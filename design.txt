dungeon brawler 2

level layouts
	structured level layouts - several rooms then boss, get item, next floor
	enemies come from edges kinda like vampire survivors - swarm floors - monster house!
		big text flashes up on screen when this happens
		what other events like this can we add?
	enemies come from entrances of unexplored areas
	some levels have rooms or snaking pathways connecting the entrances

diff chars to choose from with diff attacks, stats, & supers
	--hold a+d or left+right to charge up & use super ability
		big text or some kind of cool animation when this happens
	--ctrls for wasd, ijkl, arrow keys, & mouse
		gamepad controls?
	char ideas
		maou castle
			healer
			ninja/rogue
				rapid fire med range daggers
				ult - become invisible (enemies dont target you, maybe bullets can't hit you either?)
			wizard
				huge, slow, long range, slow fire rate, seeking fireballs
		space
			spaceship pilot with laser gun
			slow firing but powerful railgun char
				maybe this is just ult for pilot?
			robot
			alien

starting room
	start out as spark/ghost & choose char from lineup
	target dummies to test your attacks on
	button to add/remove ai chars
		hold buttons for a sec to take control of ai, it takes ctrl back after 2s idle?

choose from selection of items after beating boss
	walk over one to pick it up & see desc, can swap out with others by walking over
		them & prev held one goes back to orig pos - go to exit to apply
	sometimes you get secret but powerful item (u dont know what it is until u equip)
	spawn 1 treasure chest for each player that has to be opened to reveal item

items
	how do we make fun & simple synergies with these?
		events - shoot bullet, deal dmg, take dmg, kill enemy, die, hit wall with bullet,
			hit nothing with bullet, pierce through x enemies
		modifiers - bullets bounce, seeking bullets, bullet piercing, knockback
	item ideas
		--if item creates bullets, use it's own sprite for those bullets (if applicable, like for weps)
		common
			--dagger - every 3rd enemy hit, shoot a short range dagger
			--poison vial - on enemy kill spawn bullet that targets nearest enemy
			--quickbow - every 3rd pierce on 2 enemies, fire 3 arrows in rapid succession
			--arrow - every 3rd shot gains +1 piercing
			--fire staff - shoot fireball at random enemy every 3s
			--healing staff - shoot a seeking healing bullet at teammate every 5s
			--sword - every 5th enemy killed, spawn aoe of bullets around self
			--vampire sword - every 3rd enemy killed, heal 1 hp
			
			--flame armor - on taking dmg, spawn aoe ring of bullets around yourself
			--ninja armor - on taking dmg, shoot a dagger back at your attacker
		rare - these are gonna be like really really rare
			--poison jug - spawn aoe of bullets around enemy on kill
			--mega crossbow - every 3rd pierce on 2 enemies, shoot a mega piercing arrow that ignores walls
			--quiver - all shots gain +1 piercing

can choose diff areas at the start - sets enemies, bosses, environment hazards, & even items
enemies appear differently in diff areas - castle = rise up from ground, space station = warp in, etc
	demon lord castle
		--skeleton & vampire enemies
		minibosses - each have flavor text like gyoubu from sekirou
		loot rooms to get items in?
			diff rarities - common = +1 armor or dmg, rare = spawn more bullets, etc
				-> golden chest is higher tier loot
	space station
		spider enemies
		laser beams & such
		bullet hell level where all the players are shooting up at the boss & dodging bullet hell bullets
	undersea
	graveyard
	forest
		elves, wolves, mushroom, tree, & other forest related enemies




--sometimes big versions of regular enemies spawn with scaled sprite, more hp, slower spd, & diff bullet patterns
show hearts when player takes dmg
	also show when standing still?
custom font drawing system with 3x5 font
	define rect for it to be drawn in
ghost ult can spawn little health bauble for living players
