dungeon brawler 2

level layouts
	structured level layouts - several rooms then boss, get item, next floor
	enemies come from edges kinda like vampire survivors - swarm floors - monster house!
		big text flashes up on screen when this happens
		what other events like this can we add?
	enemies come from entrances of unexplored areas
	some levels have rooms or snaking pathways connecting the entrances

diff chars to choose from with diff attacks, stats, & supers
	--hold a+d or left+right to charge up & use super ability
		big text or some kind of cool animation when this happens
	--ctrls for wasd, ijkl, arrow keys, & mouse
	char ideas
		healer
		spaceship pilot with laser gun

starting room
	start out as spark/ghost & choose char from lineup
	target dummies to test your attacks on
	button to add/remove ai chars

choose from selection of items after beating boss
	walk over one to pick it up & see desc, can swap out with others by walking over
		them & prev held one goes back to orig pos - go to exit to apply
	sometimes you get secret but powerful item (u dont know what it is until u equip)

can choose diff areas at the start - sets enemies, bosses, environment hazards, & even items
enemies appear differently in diff areas - castle = rise up from ground, space station = warp in, etc
	demon lord castle
		--skeleton & vampire enemies
		minibosses - each have flavor text like gyoubu from sekirou
		loot rooms to get items in?
			diff rarities - common = +1 armor or dmg, rare = spawn more bullets, etc
	space station

		laser beams & such
	undersea

sometimes big versions of regular enemies spawn with scaled up sprite, more hp, slower spd, & diff bullet pattern
